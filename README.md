# KOHO Case Study

## Overview and Origin:


The KOHO company was incorporated in 2014. It was founded by Daniel Eberhard. The idea for the company came about on the belief that the primary spending account was the most important part of the customer relationship. This company is funded by 16 investors of which the following 4 are the lead investors: TTV Capital, Drive Capital, Portage Ventures, and Power Financial Corporation. KOHO has received a total of $113.4M in funding.

 
## Business Activities:

KOHO is trying to solve the problem of banks charging fees to consumers, while consumers don't know what those fees are for. In addition, the banks are making profit while Canadians are paying banking fees that are among the highest in the world. KOHO wants to show Canadians that there is an alternative to the big 5 banks by providing better financial solutions to spend and save, with no hidden fees, no fine print, and no catch. KOHO, however, is not a bank itself. It has partnered with Peoples Trust which is a federally regulated bank. Customers' money is held in that bank. Customers can load money into the app and use a Visa debit card to make purchases. Users also have the option of having their paycheque deposited into their KOHO account, thus eliminating the need for a conventional bank and being charged the unwanted banking fees.

The intended customers are Millennials or younger people that typically do not want to go to a bank or pay high fees for having a savings or chequing account. Canadian Millennials made up 27% of the total population in 2019. Millennials are the largest generation in Canada. Unlike other competitors that offer Visa debit cards, KOHO offers 0.5% cash-back on all purchases. 

KOHO is currently using 113 technologies in 17 categories including: <br>
*Devops and Development:* Netlify, Github, Amazon EC2 <br>
*Business Intelligence and Analytics:* Segment, Google Analytics, Amazon Forecast <br>
*Programming Languages And Frameworks:* JavaScript, Java, Amazon DynamoDB <br>
*Platform And Storage:* Amazon Web Services, Linux, Google Cloud Storage <br>
*It Security:* AWS Secrets Manager, AWS Identity and Access Management, HackerOne <br><br>
However, KOHO’s main technologies are: Crunchbase (market research), G Suite (Project Collaboration), Verint (market research), Intercom (Sales Management), Netlify (Devops and Development), and Shopify Plus (E-commerce platform).

## Landscape:

KOHO is in the personal finance domain of the financial industry.

The major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years have included customers having access to smartphones and thus apps. Also, open banking which allows banks to share their data with FinTech companies, done through an API. As well as, financial inclusion which gives people access to services such as saving, payments, and lending no matter their financial situation. Lastly, artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies which allow for automated decision-making.

The other major Canadian companies in this domain are moka (formerly Mylo), ratehub.ca, Mogo, Neo Financial, and STACK.

## Results:

So far, the business impact of KOHO is such that it is processing $2 billion in annual transactions. The Millennials are using the app about 8 times per month and are putting about one third to one half of their paycheques into their KOHO accounts. And since KOHO plans to remain free for life, it hopes to attract more young people that will use their Visa payment cards to spend more but within their budgets.

Some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success include: acquisition metrics, activation metrics, retention metrics, referrals, revenues, marketing metrics, and technical metrics. Based on these metrics KOHO is performing well, it has over 375, 000 Canadian users.

KOHO is performing well relative to competitors in the same domain, however Mogo has more than one million customers which is more than twice the number that KOHO has. 

## Recommendations:

If I were to advise KOHO, I would suggest that they give the users the ability to donate to a charity. Perhaps by allowing them to set aside small amounts of money that can be accumulated to a sufficient amount that would enable the user to obtain a tax receipt from the charity.

I think that offering this service would attract the younger generation to the app. They would feel great about doing a good deed and having it made easy for them to do it. And rather than donating small amounts at retail stores where the customer doesn’t get a tax receipt, KOHO would stand out by helping charities while helping their customers.
This additional service would utilize technologies such: as Netlify, crunchbase, and Shopify Plus. These technologies are appropriate for my solution because they would allow KOHO to develop the additional feature and do market research of consumers' interest in donating to charities. As well as determine what charities are popular among their customers so that KOHO could maybe collaborate with the charities and thus have an even greater impact.
